## My Goals

I am **Directly Responsible** for attracting, growing, and retaining talented people. This is my core job -- people will always come first.

I am **Held Accountable** (by my boss, our stakeholders, and the team as a whole) for the outcomes delivered by my team. Delivery is your core job -- helping you do your job will mean I'm doing mine. 

## What I Value
I am an annoyingly old-school Agilist, so in the spirit of the Agile Manifesto*:

### In my time in the software industry, I have come to value
**The Truth** over **Assumptions** 

**Making Things Better** over **Seeking An Ideal**

**Failure** over **Stasis**

**Emotional Intelligence** over **Technical Skill**

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, I value the items on the left more.

**Our Relationship:** A healthy working relationship is key to our success. We need to be able to communicate openly, honestly, with a healthy dose of disagreement. That requires work from both of us.
**Your Growth:** I want you to be able and empowered to do your best work. 


## The Day-To-Day
### What You Can Expect
We will have bi-weekly, 30 minute 1:1s on the calendar. If you need more time, I'm happy to add more. I do want to make sure I'm making good use of your time. The last thing I want is us staring at each other going "yup......yup" when you could be off doing your thing. 

1:1s are for *you*. It's your time with me to discuss what you want -- your career, the team, the job, board games. I'm loquacious to a fault, and I am constantly working to counteract that. *Please* don't hesitate to stop me if you've got something you'd like to cover. 

I like to use 15Five to maintain some shape for our 1:1s, especially as a way of cutting down on my tendency to ramble. But I don't want to force you to fill them out if you don't find them meaningful. If there's something you'd like to discuss, add it to our upcoming 1:1 in 15Five and we can cover it.

### Communication
I am most easily reached via Slack or email. I consider both of these to be asynchronous, which means while I will strive to get back to you in a timely fashion, it probably won't be immediate. If you need me urgently, either call or text me (my number is in Pingboard). By default, I will observe the same rules for communicating with you. If it's urgent, it'll be by phone or text. I might ping you on Slack for something time-sensitive, like "who wants the other half of this sandwich?", but don't consider it must-drop-everything priority. ðŸ¥ª

If you need some time with me, go ahead and put something on my calendar. I am pretty rigorous in keeping my availability current, especially in COVID-19 times, so if it's open on my calendar, it's game. I reserve the right to reschedule things, though. ðŸ˜„
